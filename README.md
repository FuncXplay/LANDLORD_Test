Using Binder dataset, download `binder.sqlite` file into project folder first or use binder to access from jupyter-notebook.



### LANDLORD

Reuse larger containers in cache

When no larger containers to reuse, check Jacaard distance and, from those containers with a Jaccard distance no larger than ` ALPHA`, merge the container with the smallest Jaccard distance.

Already tested with 50000 requests with `ALPHA = 0.5` and `ALPHA = 0.3`
