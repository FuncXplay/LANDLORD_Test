Jaccard = 1 - |A & B| / |A | B|
alpha = 0.5, means we have edge set A, B. B has a size of 1 and A has a size of 2. Also B is subset of A. 

When we face different versions of packages, may have trouble.
Assume that A has an older package, say "matplotlib==3.2.2", and B has it's new version, "matplotlib==3.4.3".
Generally, do we expect to see LANDLORD treat them as the same package and do update? Or in what case we need to maintain older version?

if we see them as same packages, we'll get a Jaccard distence of 0.5, else, we'll get a Jaccard distence of 1
Let's try
